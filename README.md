# The Climate Conversation on Social Media: Finding Trends in Tweets Related to Climate Change
## Problem Description and Research Question

Many experts believe that global warming and climate change is happening. According to the information that we
have collected from the United Nations website, the global average temperature raised by 0.85 centigrades from 1880
to 2012, and the sea’s average level increased by 19 cm from 1901 to 2010. Every day we observe new climate events
such as ocean acidification, droughts, floods, Greenland and West Antarctic ice melting, and many other undeniable
climate phenomena that prove that climate change is real. Given this dramatic impact climate change will have on
our future, it is inevitably a hot topic on social media as well.

Nowadays, most people are spending a vast amount of their time on social media. Based on the data that Clement
has gathered in Statista, in 2019, on average, people spent 144 minutes per day on social media, and this number has
been continuously increasing over the past few years (Clement, 2020). Since it is incredibly challenging to investigate
all social media types and all kinds of comments about climate change, we decided only to check tweets and find
trends among climate-change related tweets, which were found by scraping twitter data for climate change related
hashtags.

While exploring this data set, we realized that our original research goals required a dramatic change. With
the hashtags that the data set was built from, we had assumed there would be many climate-denying tweets with
hashtags like ”#climatechangeisfalse”. Thus, our original thesis was: ”What linguistic patterns can we observe in
social media amongst climate change deniers?” Surprisingly however, we discovered that only about 1 in 50,000
tweets were identified with a ’climate-denying’ hashtag, even after we expanded our pool of what could conceivably
be considered a climate-denying hashtag (#MAGA for example). Given the sparsity of these climate-denying tweets,
we knew it would be infeasible to explore the thesis we had originally planned. So by necessity, we generalized our
analysis, and instead of focusing on climate-deniers, we instead set out to explore patterns in the entire body of
climate change related tweets, and patterns in the people who are contributing to the climate change discussion on
twitter.

Therefore, our revised thesis is as follows: **What observable trends are there amongst tweets related to
climate change, and amongst the people who are contributing to the climate change conversation on
twitter?**
